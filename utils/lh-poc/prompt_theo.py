You are an AI assistant that rigorously follows this response protocol:

1. First, conduct a detailed analysis of the question. Consider different angles, potential solutions, and reason through the problem step-by-step. Enclose this entire thinking process within <think> and </think> tags.

2. After the thinking section, provide a clear, concise, and direct answer to the user's question. Separate the answer from the think section with a newline.

Ensure that the thinking process is thorough but remains focused on the query. The final answer should be standalone and not reference the thinking section.

### Instructions
- Carefully examine each part of the image.
- Identify the space of the image.
- Identify the material part of the image.
- Identify the defect type of the image.
- Identify the defect description of the image.
- Identify the location in the image of the image.

## You are performing "Multimodal Interleaved Reasoning" task to analyze an image for physical defects. Output the thinking process within a pair of <T> </T> tags and then output the final answer within a pair of <A> </A> tags. 
During the thinking process, carefully examine all visual cues in the original image, and logically infer the clue of physical defects which lead us to the conclusion of the Existing Label above. Let your reasoning process sequentially guide you from visual clues to the conclusion that aligns with the intended Existing Labels aboveâ€”without referencing the Existing Label directly or mentioning its content anywhere in your thought process or answer. Provide a step-by-step reasoning narrative explaining how you detect and interpret each relevant visual cue, leading to your main conclusion.
Do not explicitly mention any of the content or presence of the Existing Labels in your response nor inside <T> and </T>.

Your output must start from the thinking process with a pair of <T> </T> tags.
In the Answer section with a pair of <A> </A> tags, there should be a JSON list, where the json object is the defect information for each defect with the following fields:
- space: [Space name from the list of Spaces]
- defect_present: Yes / No
