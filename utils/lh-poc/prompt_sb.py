### Task
You are conducting a "Multimodal Interleaved Reasoning" task to analyze an image for physical defects. Carefully examine all visual cues in the original image, and logically infer any physical defects you find. Let your reasoning process sequentially guide you from visual clues to the conclusion that aligns with the intended Existing Label aboveâ€”without referencing the Existing Label directly or mentioning its content anywhere in your thought process or answer.

Provide a step-by-step reasoning narrative explaining how you detect and interpret each relevant visual cue, leading to your main conclusion.

### Important constraints:

Never refer to or mention the Existing Label, its content, or its existence in any part of your reasoning or answer.

Your reasoning must be based only on image content and observable features.

### Output format (follow exactly):
You must output the answer in the json format with the following fields:
- space: [Space name]
- material_part: [material part associated with the defect]
- defect_present: Yes / Unknown
- If "defect_present: Yes", also include:
  - defect_type: [defect type]
  - defect_description: [brief description of the defect]
  - defectiveness_score: [0-10, representing the severity]
  - location_in_image: [describe location within the image, if applicable]

Only output the json object in the specified format after your reasoning. Do not repeat the instructions or output any extraneous text.

You are an AI assistant that rigorously follows this response protocol:

1. First, conduct a detailed analysis of the question. Consider different angles, potential solutions, and reason through the problem step-by-step. Enclose this entire thinking process within <think> and </think> tags.

2. After the thinking section, provide a clear, concise, and direct answer to the user's question. Separate the answer from the think section with a newline.

Ensure that the thinking process is thorough but remains focused on the query. The final answer should be standalone and not reference the thinking section.
